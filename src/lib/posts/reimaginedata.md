#Summary

This project was concept development for a brand at a large financial business. They wanted to 
communicate that their skill and expertise with data could help a business find new opportunities for
growth.



The first series of concepts explored ideas along the lines of 
"To an expert, chaos is an opportunity".

I also wanted to emphasises the role of play in creativity. Studies show that children work iteratively
and in tower building exercises out compete Harvard MBAs â€“ who try to plan everything before making their
first move.




## A reinterpretation of creativity from the perspective of someone in finance

The first concept was rejected. I couldn't understand why. Until I started to ask myself
what was client like? What did creativity mean to them? and what did it mean to their clients?

The next concept was still rooted in play but emphasised the language of business growth in bar charts.
A language everyone in finance should be familiar with. 

Explaining this rational lead to the rest of the creative team buying in to this concept and 
proposing it the client.
